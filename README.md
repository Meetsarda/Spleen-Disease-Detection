# Spleen Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of hypersplenism using clinical and hematological features through machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Model training, preprocessing, and evaluation
- `web/` – Frontend demo UI
- `screenshots/` – UI or result images (optional)

## Machine Learning Approach
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Models used: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Web Interface
The HTML-based interface is a **demonstration tool** that simulates risk prediction using rule-based logic.

⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**  
The web interface does NOT directly use the trained ML model.  
The actual machine learning implementation exists only in the Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies  
2. Open and run the notebook  
3. Open the UI  
- Open `web/hypersplenism_ui.html` in a browser

## Disclaimer
This project is for academic and learning purposes only and is not intended for real clinical diagnosis.
